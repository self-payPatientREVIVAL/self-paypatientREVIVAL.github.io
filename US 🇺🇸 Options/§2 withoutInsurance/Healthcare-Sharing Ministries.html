  <h1>As per the website:<blockquote cite="https://web.archive.org/web/20210308044505/http://selfpaypatient.com/category/health-sharing-ministries/">Sharing organizations are voluntary associations of people who agree to share medical bills between them, similar to insurance. They are typically less expensive than conventional health insurance, and for some ministries members are exempt from paying the Obamacare tax for being uninsured.</blockquote></h1>
  <h2>
    <p>Chapter 2: ‚ÄúFunding Healthcare without Health Insurance‚Äù (p.23-37)
      <br>‚ÄúHealthcare-Sharing Ministries‚Äù (p.25-28)
      <br>menu in p.25
    </p>
    <p>The book (published back in 2014) mentions in its menu 4 healthcare-sharing ministries (H.S.M's), which are religious alternatives to health-insurance:
      <ul>
        <li>Samaritan Ministries International (S.M.I.), also known as <a href="https://samaritanministries.org/">Samaritan‚Ñ¢ Ministries</a></li>
        <li>the Gospel Light Mennonite Church Medical Aid Plan, Inc.'s <a href="https://www.libertyhealthshare.org/">Liberty HealthShare¬Æ (L.H.S)</a></li>
        <li>Christian Healthcare Ministries, Inc., or <a href="https://www.chministries.org/">Christian Healthcare Ministries (C.H.M.)</a></li>
        <li>Christian Care Ministry, Inc., or <a href="https://mychristiancare.org/">Christian Care Ministry (C.C.M.)</a>
          <ul>
            <li>C.C.M.'s <a href="https://www.medishare.com/">Medi-Share</a></li>
          </ul>
        </li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <p>But afterward, Mr. Parnell came to know and list more options, the Altrua Ministries (d.b.a. ‚ÄúAltrua HealthShare</a>‚Äù, d.b.a. ‚Äú<a href="https://altruahealthshare.org/">Altrua SmileShare</a>‚Äù), the specifically-Catholic <a href="https://cmfcuro.com/">CURO</a> (of the <a href="https://christmedicus.org/">Christ Medicus Foundation</a>), the more Catholic-leaning <a href="https://www.solidarityhealthshare.org/">Solidarity HealthShare¬Æ</a> (of the Melita Christian Fellowship Hospital Aid Plan) with the Solidarity HealthShare Foundation, Inc. He also discovered and secured the sponsorship of The Health Co-Op, which has since exited the market for individual patients‚Ä¶ and has interestingly serviced/helped-out its former-competitor, <a href="https://go.thekarisgroup.com/resources/case-study-samaritan-ministries">Samaritan‚Ñ¢ Ministries</a>.</p>
    <p>Also, a new thing has happened: the creation of the <a href="https://ahcsm.org/">Alliance of Health Care Sharing Ministries (the Alliance)</a>, whose membership includes 3 of the ministries mentioned in the book (Christian Care Ministry, Samaritan‚Ñ¢ Ministries, and Liberty HealthShare¬Æ). The Alliance also has OneShare Health, L.L.C. (<a href="https://www.onesharehealth.com/">OneShare Health¬Æ</a>) as a member.</p>
    <p>An option to consider may also be CrowdHealth, Inc. (<a href="https://www.joincrowdhealth.com/">CrowdHealth</a>). A word ofwarning, though: Neither Mr. Pernell nor I have vetted it. I only recently discovered its existence. OneShare Health¬Æ is also a new discover to me, but 3 of the vetted ministries have deemed them worthy of membership to the Alliance. No word yet from them about CrowdHealth.</p>
  </h2>
  <h1>ALSO: DO YOUR RESEARCH with H.S.M.'s! Some have gotten into legal-trouble, even getting banned from operating in certain States. (Also, full disclosure: I've personally been a member of L.H.S. for a decade now.)</h1>
  <h2>Now that the caveats have been mentioned, how do H.S.M.'s work?
    <ul>
      <li>Since they're legally NOT INSURANCE, insurance-terms are not be used with them. Hence, each ministry has its own terminology. For example, premiums are't collected by L.H.S.: "monthly contrubutions" are. The said ministry has no insurance-plan with any deductables, but an "Annual Unshared Amount (A.U.M.)" does exist with each level of membership offered.</li>
      <li>The system runs on altruism, mutual-charity, and religious obligaiton, as opposed to legal entitlements.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Has the last point been abused before? You bet! (Recently, <a href="https://www.dfs.ny.gov/reports_and_publications/press_releases/pr202109281">bankruptcy was filed</a> by a so-called "Trinity HealthShare" that the Alliance has rightly called a "sham" <a href="https://www.christianitytoday.com/2022/04/health-care-sharing-ministries-bankrupt-sharity-trinity-unp/">after being found guilty of fraud</a>.) Be careful who gets awarded your money!</p>
    <p><h1>A note on L.H.S.: Things have been rocky in L.H.S. with since 2020, and I'd like to compare notes with members of other H.S.M.'s, if possible. How are thing in your ministry? Taking the numbers reported in the members' e-mail newsletters and squeezing as much as I can from them on spreadsheets, I got this:</h1>
    <ul>
      <li>When I joined in 2014, contribtuions & shared bills were practically 1:1, and just under $60k per month. In just 1 year, that jumped to $1mil. We, the membership, were healthy & health-conscious people. BUT mainstream news-media started catching-on and raising awareness of H.S.M.'s existence. Wider society joined en masse! By 2016, $5mil was normal for L.H.S.'s monthly revenue from July onward. It was 2017, when the troubles began, with multi-million dollar monthly deficits appearing every do often. Not a problem, apparently, since monthly contributions of $20mil were starting, too. Big money! What could possibly go wrong? By 2018, the monthly-rate was hiked by June (AFTER deficits of $10mil & approaching were added to monthly deficits), so contribution did jump to the 1x-maximum of $48mil by December. For 2019, monthly revenue averaged $30mil, it seemed progress was made to address the backlog‚Ä¶ And then, COVID attacked! From 2020-2021, the contrubution-rate was raised again, top-leadership was replaced, and the membership-offerings were overhauled. The year 2022 was the year debt-elimination was on the forefront. By September 2024, 74% of the backlog was paid-off. As of December 2024, no furhter updates on paying-off the debt has been issued. (WHY‚ÄΩ) Also, monthly contributions have dropped to just below $12mil/month. (sigh)</li>
      <li>So if you've read/heard of (current/former) L.H.S.-members complaining of unpaid expenses, this is why: the L.H.S. took-in too many high-expense new-members and failed to raise the monthly contrubution-rate accordingly. Also, a newsletter reported disingenuous "pump & dump"-members, who left directly after incurring and reporting heavy medical-bills. Then, there are reports like <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/liberty-healthshare-beers-family-insurance-ppp-ohio">this</a> & <a href="https://www.propublica.org/article/liberty-healthshare-healthcare-sharing-ministries-obamacare">this</a>. How much of it is real, and how much of it is a smear-campaign from the insurance-industry, which would certainly benefit from the elimination of insurance-alternatives?</li>
      <li>Personally, I'm healthy: I barely really need the routine, annual checkups. That said, my medical-bills have ALWAYS been paid from 2014 to today (late-2024), or I would have dropped my membership long ago! God willing, L.H.S.'s new leadership will continue the course of reforms & backlog-burning, so that the ministry will be debt-free by the end of 2025! üôè</li>
      <li>If you're a member of another H.S.M. (whether listed here or not), wen did you join and how have things been with your ministry so far?</li>
    </p>
